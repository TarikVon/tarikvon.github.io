questions of Systems Analysis & Design-10th Edition</h1><h2 id=chapter-1-systems-roles-and-development-methodologies><a class=markdownIt-Anchor href=#chapter-1-systems-roles-and-development-methodologies></a> Chapter 1: Systems, Roles, and Development Methodologies</h2><ol><li><p><strong>List the advantages of using systems analysis and design techniques in approaching computerized information systems for business.</strong></p> <p>System analysis and design techniques provide the analyst with a systematic procedure for analyzing data input, UML diagrams or data flow, and information output; furthermore, the techniques can improve the functioning of business.</p><li><p><strong>Why is security of information systems an important consideration in systems development and design?</strong></p> <p>Developing privacy controls and security by design, from the outset of systems design, is much more desirable and effective than adding it to older, legacy systems.</p><li><p><strong>List three roles that the systems analyst is called upon to play. Provide a definition for each one.</strong></p> <p>The three roles of a system analyst are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Consultant</strong>: Hired from outside an organization to address information systems issues within that organization.<li><strong>Supporting Expert</strong>: Serves as a resource for those who are managing a systems project.<li><strong>Change Agent</strong>: An analyst who serves as a catalyst for change, develops a plan for change, and works with others in facilitating that change.</ul><li><p><strong>What personal qualities are helpful to the systems analyst? List them.</strong></p> <p>Personal qualities helpful to systems analysts include:</p> <ul><li>Problem-solving abilities<li>Communication skills<li>Computer experience<li>Self-discipline and self-motivation<li>Project management capabilities</ul><li><p><strong>List and briefly define the seven phases of the systems development life cycle (SDLC).</strong></p> <p>The seven phases of the SDLC are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Identifying problems, opportunities, and objectives</strong>: Recognizing problems and opportunities confronting the business and determining business objectives.<li><strong>Determining information requirements</strong>: Understanding what information users need to perform their jobs.<li><strong>Analyzing system needs</strong>: Structured analysis of information needs and decision making.<li><strong>Designing the recommended system</strong>: Logical design of the information system.<li><strong>Developing and documenting software</strong>: Structured development of software and documentation.<li><strong>Testing and maintaining the system</strong>: Testing and revising the system.<li><strong>Implementing and evaluating the system</strong>: Training users and reviewing the system.</ul><li><p><strong>What are CASE tools used for?</strong></p> <p>The reasons for using CASE tools are:</p> <ul><li>Increasing analyst productivity<li>Improving analyst-user communication<li>Integrating life cycle activities</ul><li><p><strong>Define what is meant by the agile approach.</strong></p> <p>The agile approach is based on values, principles, and core practices. It values communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage.</p><li><p><strong>What is the meaning of the phrase “the planning game”?</strong></p> <p>The planning game spells out rules that can help formulate the agile development team’s relationship with their business customers. The rules are a basis for building and maintaining a relationship.</p><li><p><strong>What are the stages in agile development?</strong></p> <p>The five stages in agile development are exploration, planning, iterations to the first release, productionizing, and maintenance.</p><li><p><strong>What is Scrum?</strong></p> <p>Scrum is an agile method focused on extremely quick releases.</p><li><p><strong>Define the term object-oriented analysis and design.</strong></p> <p>Object-oriented analysis and design are techniques intended to facilitate the development of systems that must change rapidly in response to dynamic business environments.</p><li><p><strong>What is UML?</strong></p> <p>UML is the Unified Modeling Language, a standardized object-oriented language used to break down a system into a use case model.</p><li><p><strong>What is open source software?</strong></p> <p>Open source software is when many users and programmers can study, share, and modify the code, or computer instructions.</p><li><p><strong>What is the role of a systems analyst in the development of open source software?</strong></p> <p>They must first prove themselves worthy members of the group, and then strike up and maintain relationships that are mutually beneficial.</p><li><p><strong>List two reasons an organization may want its analysts to participate in an open source community.</strong></p> <p>Two reasons that an organization may want its analysts to participate in an open source community are curiosity about software benefits and to achieve collective design.</p></ol><h2 id=chapter-2-understanding-and-modeling-organizational-systems><a class=markdownIt-Anchor href=#chapter-2-understanding-and-modeling-organizational-systems></a> Chapter 2: Understanding and Modeling Organizational Systems</h2><ol><li><p><strong>What are the three groups of organizational fundamentals that carry implications for the development of information systems?</strong></p> <p>The three groups of organizational fundamentals include:</p> <ul><li><strong>Level of management</strong><li><strong>Design of organizations</strong><li><strong>Other factors</strong>: leadership style, technology, and organizational subcultures</ul><li><p><strong>What is meant by saying that organizational subsystems are interrelated and interdependent?</strong></p> <p>Organizational subsystems are said to be interrelated and interdependent when a change in one subsystem affects other subsystems.</p><li><p><strong>Define the term organizational boundary.</strong></p> <p>An organizational boundary separates the system from its environment.</p><li><p><strong>What are the two main purposes for feedback in organizations?</strong></p> <p>The two main purposes of feedback are (a) system control and (b) formulating and revising organizational goals.</p><li><p><strong>Define openness in an organizational environment.</strong></p> <p>Openness refers to an organization with a relatively free flow of information within its boundaries.</p><li><p><strong>Define closedness in an organizational environment.</strong></p> <p>Closedness refers to an organization with relatively little flow of information within its boundaries.</p><li><p><strong>What is the difference between a traditional organization and a virtual one?</strong></p> <p>A traditional organization is one that has a physical location, whereas a virtual organization has parts of the organization in different locations, connected electronically.</p><li><p><strong>What are the potential benefits and a drawback of a virtual organization?</strong></p> <p>The benefits of a virtual organization are: reduced costs of physical facilities, a more rapid response to customer needs, and flexibility for employees to care for children or aging parents. A drawback is that it is difficult to meet the social needs of virtual workers.</p><li><p><strong>Give an example of how systems analysts could work with users as a virtual team.</strong></p> <p>The example provided in the text allows the analyst to see the software and hardware configuration of the user requesting help.</p><li><p><strong>What are enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems?</strong></p> <p>Enterprise systems, often referred to as Enterprise Resource Planning systems, is a term used to describe an integrated organizational (enterprise) information system.</p><li><p><strong>What is the main difference between doing business process analysis for ERP and for other types of systems?</strong></p> <p>One major difference is that rather than redesigning business processes based on a logical analysis of those processes and how they support the business strategy, and then choosing the IT to support those processes, a large installation of ERP can reverse this by requiring the implementation of new business processes that are embedded in the technology provided.</p><li><p><strong>What problems do analysts often encounter when they try to implement an ERP package?</strong></p> <p>One problem that the analyst encounters when trying to implement an ERP package is the difficulty of trying to analyze a system currently in use and then fit an ERP model to the system. Another problem is that the business model does not always match the ERP functionality. The impact is delayed implementation, higher costs, and the loss of user confidence.</p><li><p><strong>What are the two symbols on a use case diagram and what do they represent?</strong></p> <p>The two symbols are an actor, the role of a user of the system, and the use case representing a sequence of transactions in a system.</p><li><p><strong>What is a use case scenario?</strong></p> <p>A use case scenario is a text description of the flow of events in a use case. There may be alternate scenarios representing conditions that produce variations on the primary scenario.</p><li><p><strong>What are the three main parts of a use case scenario?</strong></p> <p>The three main parts of a use case scenario are the use case identifiers and initiators; the steps performed; and the conditions, assumptions, and questions.</p><li><p><strong>What are the four steps in creating a use case description?</strong></p> <p>Use case descriptions are created with these four steps:</p> <ul><li>Use agile stories, problem definition objectives, user requirements, or a features list.<li>Ask about the tasks that must be done.<li>Determine if there are any iterative or looping actions.<li>The use case ends when the customer goal is complete.</ul><li><p><strong>What are the five altitude metaphors for describing use case on different levels? What do they represent?</strong></p> <p>The five altitude metaphors and what they represent are:</p> <ul><li><strong>White (like clouds)</strong>: Enterprise level<li><strong>Kite</strong>: Business unit or department level<li><strong>Blue (sea level)</strong>: User goals<li><strong>Indigo (or fish)</strong>: Functional or subfunctional<li><strong>Black (or clam)</strong>: Most detailed</ul><li><p><strong>What does a process represent on a context-level data flow diagram?</strong></p> <p>A process represents the whole system on a context-level data flow diagram.</p><li><p><strong>What is an entity on a data flow diagram?</strong></p> <p>An entity on a data flow diagram represents an entity that supplies and receives information that is outside of the system.</p><li><p><strong>What is meant by the term entity-relationship diagram?</strong></p> <p>An entity-relationship diagram is a graphical depiction of organizational system elements and the association among the elements.</p><li><p><strong>What symbols are used to draw E-R diagrams?</strong></p> <p>The three symbols used for E-R diagrams are:</p> <ul><li>A rectangle to show the entity<li>A diamond in a rectangle to join two many-to-many entities<li>An oval in a rectangle to represent an attribute, especially a repeating group</ul><li><p><strong>List the types of E-R diagrams.</strong></p> <p>The types of E-R diagrams are:</p> <ul><li>One-to-one relationship<li>One-to-many relationship<li>Many-to-one relationship<li>Many-to-many relationship</ul><li><p><strong>How do an entity, an associative entity, and an attributive entity differ?</strong></p> <p>An entity represents a person, place, or thing. An associative entity can only join two fundamental entities. An attributive entity is used to represent an attribute of an entity, often a repeating group, and cannot exist without being linked to a fundamental entity.</p><li><p><strong>List the three broad, horizontal levels of management in organizations.</strong></p> <p>The three levels of management in organizations are:</p> <ul><li>Operations management<li>Middle management<li>Strategic management</ul><li><p><strong>Who should be involved in collaborative design of information systems?</strong></p> <p>Those who should be involved in collaborative design are:</p> <ul><li>Those in lower ranks of the organization<li>For external collaborations, relevant stakeholders</ul><li><p><strong>How can understanding organizational subcultures help in the design of information systems?</strong></p> <p>Organizational subcultures affect information requirements, information availability, use of information, and individual behavior.</p><li><p><strong>How can systems analysis team members use Slack to build or reinforce an organizational culture or subculture?</strong></p> <p>By adopting an employer-sanctioned social media platform to foster collaboration and communication among office workers. It may be more effective than email since employees may interact in a less formal setting, which could help team members to avoid the difficulty of expressing themselves face-to-face in a meeting or even one to one.</p></ol><h2 id=chapter-3-project-management><a class=markdownIt-Anchor href=#chapter-3-project-management></a> Chapter 3: Project Management</h2><ol><li><p><strong>What are the five major project fundamentals?</strong></p> <p>The five major project fundamentals are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Project initiation</strong><li><strong>Determining project feasibility</strong><li><strong>Scheduling of the project</strong><li><strong>Managing activities</strong><li><strong>Managing team members</strong></ul><li><p><strong>List three ways to find out about problems or opportunities that might call for a systems solution.</strong></p> <p>Three ways to find out about problems or opportunities are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Checking output</strong><li><strong>Observing or researching employee behavior</strong><li><strong>Listening to feedback from external sources</strong></ul><li><p><strong>List the five criteria for systems project selection.</strong></p> <p>The five criteria for systems project selection are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Management backing</strong><li><strong>Adequate time frame</strong><li><strong>Alignment with organizational goals</strong><li><strong>Adequate resources on the part of the analyst and the organization</strong><li><strong>The worthiness of the project</strong></ul><li><p><strong>Define technical feasibility.</strong></p> <p>A project is technically feasible if the technology is available and capable of meeting users’ requests.</p><li><p><strong>Define economic feasibility.</strong></p> <p>A project is economically feasible if costs do not overshadow benefits.</p><li><p><strong>Define operational feasibility.</strong></p> <p>A project is operationally feasible if the proposed system will operate and be used once it is installed.</p><li><p><strong>List four criteria for evaluating system hardware.</strong></p> <p>They are time required for average transactions, total volume capacity of the system, idle time of the central processing unit, and size of memory provided.</p><li><p><strong>What two main options do organizations have for acquiring or using computer hardware?</strong></p> <p>They are buying hardware, and using cloud services.</p><li><p><strong>What does COTS stand for?</strong></p> <p>COTS is an acronym for commercial off-the-shelf.</p><li><p><strong>List five of the many benefits of cloud computing for organizations.</strong></p> <p>The benefits of cloud computing for organizations are:</p> <ul><li>Less time spent maintaining legacy systems or performing routine tasks such as maintenance or upgrading of present systems.<li>Possibly making it simpler to acquire IT services and making it easier and quicker to separate from or discontinue services that are no longer necessary.<li>Making your applications scalable.<li>Providing consistency across multiple platforms perhaps previously disjointed or difficult to integrate.<li>No capital is tied up, and no financing is required.</ul><li><p><strong>List three of the many drawbacks of cloud computing for organizations.</strong></p> <p>The drawbacks of cloud computing are:</p> <ul><li>The loss of control of data stored in the cloud.<li>If the cloud services provider ceased to exist, it is unclear what would happen to the organization’s data.<li>Potential security threats to data that is not stored on premises or even on the organization’s own computers.<li>Reliability of the Internet as a platform.<li>The prospect that the company could get stuck using application programming interfaces (APIs) that are proprietary with the cloud provider.</ul><li><p><strong>What does BYOD stand for?</strong></p> <p>BYOD stands for “bring your own device.”</p><li><p><strong>What are the benefits of BYOD to an organization?</strong></p> <p>The benefits of BYOD to an organization are a potential for lowering the initial cost of organizational IT hardware purchase, and facilitating remote ’round–the-clock access to corporate computer networks regardless of location.</p><li><p><strong>What are the benefits of BYOD to an employee?</strong></p> <p>The benefits of BYOD to an employee are building employee morale and building on a familiar user interface to access corporate computing services, applications, databases, and storage.

It usually involves specific and single objectives which are not difficult to achieve.</p><li><p><strong>What four elements must be known for the systems analyst to design systems for structured decisions?</strong></p> <p>They are conditions, condition alternatives, actions, and action rules.</p><li><p><strong>What are the two building blocks of structured English?</strong></p> <p>The two building blocks of structured English are:</p> <ul><li>Structured logic or instructions organized into nested and grouped procedures.<li>Simple English statements such as add, multiply, move, and so on.</ul><li><p><strong>List five conventions that should be followed when using structured English.</strong></p> <p>The five conventions to be followed when using structured English are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Express all logic in terms of sequential structures, decision structures, case structures, or iterations.</strong><li><strong>Use and capitalize accepted keywords such as IF, THEN, ELSE, DO, DO WHILE, DO UNTIL, and PERFORM.</strong><li><strong>Indent blocks of statements to show their hierarchy (nesting) clearly.</strong><li><strong>When words or phrases used have been defined in a data dictionary, underline those words or phrases to signify that they have a specialized, reserved meaning.</strong><li><strong>Be careful when using “and” and “or,” and avoid confusion when distinguishing between “greater than” and “greater than or equal to” and other logical comparisons.</strong></ul><li><p><strong>What is the advantage of using structured English to communicate with people in the organization?</strong></p> <p>Systems analysts can clarify the logic and relationships found in human languages and expect better communication between themselves and end users by using structured English. Also, structured English is easy to teach and understand.</p><li><p><strong>Which quadrant of the decision table is used for conditions? Which is used for condition alternatives?</strong></p> <p>The upper-left quadrant contains the conditions; the upper-right quadrant contains the condition alternatives.</p><li><p><strong>What is the first step to take in developing a decision table?</strong></p> <p>The first step in developing decision tables is the determination of the number of conditions that may affect the decision. The number of conditions becomes the number of rows in the top half of the decision table.</p><li><p><strong>List the four main problems that can occur in developing decision tables.</strong></p> <p>The four main problems that can occur in developing decision tables are incompleteness, impossible situations, contradictions, and redundancy.</p><li><p><strong>What is one way to reduce the complexity of unwieldy decision tables?</strong></p> <p>One of the ways to reduce the complexity of unwieldy decision tables is to use extended entries, use the ELSE rule, or construct multiple tables.</p><li><p><strong>What is one of the major advantages of decision tables over other methods of decision analysis?</strong></p> <p>One of the major advantages of using decision tables over other methods is that decision tables help analysts ensure completeness. It is also easy to check for possible errors, such as impossible situations, contradictions, and redundancy.</p><li><p><strong>What are the main uses of decision trees in systems analysis?</strong></p> <p>Systems analysts can use decision trees when complex branching occurs in a structured decision process. Decision trees are also useful when it is essential to keep a string of decisions in a particular sequence.</p><li><p><strong>List the four major steps in building decision trees.</strong></p> <p>The four major steps in building decision trees are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Identify the conditions.</strong><li><strong>Identify the condition alternatives.</strong><li><strong>Identify the actions.</strong><li><strong>Identify action rules (in order).</strong></ul><li><p><strong>What three advantages do decision trees have over decision tables?</strong></p> <ul><li>The order of checking conditions and executing actions is immediately noticeable.<li>Conditions and actions of decision trees are found on some branches but not on others.<li>Decision trees are more readily understood by others in the organization.</ul><li><p><strong>In which two situations should you use structured English?</strong></p> <p>Structured English is useful when there are many repetitious actions or when communication to end users is important.</p><li><p><strong>In which two situations do decision tables work best?</strong></p> <p>Decision tables are useful when complex combinations of conditions, actions, and rules are found or you require a method that effectively avoids impossible situations, redundancies, and contradictions.</p><li><p><strong>In which two situations are decision trees preferable?</strong></p> <p>Decision trees are preferable when the sequence of conditions and actions is critical or not every condition is relevant to every action.</p></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><div class=reward-container><div>我很可爱，请给我钱！</div><button>赞赏</button><div class=post-reward><div><img alt="Tarik Von 微信" src=/images/wechatpay.png><span>微信</span></div></div></div><div class=post-tags><a href=/tags/Information-Systems/ rel=tag># Information Systems</a><a href=/tags/Answers/ rel=tag># Answers</a><a href=/tags/Software-Engineering/ rel=tag># Software Engineering</a><a href=/tags/Systems-Analysis/ rel=tag># Systems Analysis</a><a href=/tags/Systems-Design/ rel=tag># Systems Design</a><a href=/tags/Course-Review/ rel=tag># Course Review</a></div><div class=post-nav><div class=post-nav-item><a href=/2024/05/26/OVERTURE/ rel=prev title=OVERTURE指令集一览表（共18条）及汇编器> <i class="fa fa-angle-left"></i> OVERTURE指令集一览表（共18条）及汇编器 </a></div><div class=post-nav-item><a title="华为云开发者实验：LSTM 模型生成文本" href=/2024/07/17/labNote-LSTM/ rel=next> 华为云开发者实验：LSTM 模型生成文本 <i class="fa fa-angle-right"></i> </a></div></div></footer></article></div></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-inner><div class=copyright>© <span itemprop=copyrightYear>2025</span><span class=with-love> <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> </span><span class=author itemprop=copyrightHolder>Tarik Von</span><span> </span><a href=https://beian.miit.gov.cn/ target=_blank>闽ICP备2025086651号-1</a></div><div class=wordcount><span class=post-meta-item> <span class=post-meta-item-icon> <i class="fa fa-chart-line"></i> </span> <span title=站点总字数>42k</span> </span><span class=post-meta-item> <span class=post-meta-item-icon> <i class="fa fa-coffee"></i> </span> <span title=站点阅读时长>2:32</span> </span></div><div class=powered-by>由 <a href=https://www.tarikvon.cn:8001/>Hexo</a> & <a href=https://theme-next.js.org/pisces/ rel=noopener target=_blank>NexT.Pisces</a> 强力驱动</div><script color=126,0,255 count=99 opacity=0.5 src=/lib/theme-next-canvas-nest/canvas-nest.js zindex=-1></script></div></footer><div aria-label=返回顶部 class=back-to-top role=button><i class="fa fa-arrow-up fa-lg"></i><span>0%</span></div><div class=reading-progress-bar></div><noscript><div class=noscript-warning>Theme NexT works best with JavaScript enabled</div></noscript><script alpha=0.6 size=300 src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ribbon.js/1.0.2/ribbon.min.js zindex=-1></script><script crossorigin=anonymous integrity=sha256-XL2inqUJaslATFnHdJOi9GfQ60on8Wx1C2H8DYiN1xY= src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/3.2.1/anime.min.js></script><script crossorigin=anonymous integrity=sha256-vxLn1tSKWD4dqbMRyv940UYw4sXgMtYcK6reefzZrao= src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/next-theme-pjax/0.6.0/pjax.min.js></script><script src=/js/comments.js></script><script src=/js/utils.js></script><script src=/js/motion.js></script><script src=/js/next-boot.js></script><script src=/js/pjax.js></script><script class=next-config data-name=enableMath type=application/json>false</script><link crossorigin=anonymous href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/KaTeX/0.16.9/katex.min.css integrity=sha256-UF1fgpAiu3tPJN/uCqEUHNe7pnr+QR0SQDNfgglgtcM= rel=stylesheet>
